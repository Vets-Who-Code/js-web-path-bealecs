## Issue #8

#### You will find issue #8 located inside /Portfolio/issues folder directory. Inside, issue #8 consists of 3 files: 
> index.css <br />
> index.html <br />
> Issue8.js <br />

#### The JS is loaded into the body tag of the html file so that the HTML can first load and then the Javascript follows. Open the index.html in your browser to view.

#### There were a lot of changes made over the past couple of days, mostly to the styles. I have made the page look more similar to my final goal for my portfolio, however I am not done styling. Issue 8 is ready to go with a new data pull from a different Api. Specifically, I used TheAudioDB api to grab information about my favorite music artist. With issue 8 done and looking pretty, I am ready to continue styling as there is still much to do on that front.
