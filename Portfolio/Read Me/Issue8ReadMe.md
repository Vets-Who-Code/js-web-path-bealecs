## Issue 8

#### Given the website that I was fetching data from:
>[SWAPI](https://swapi.dev/api/people/)
#### I navigated to the docs and found a URL to get data about Luke Skywalker. Using this, I was able to add a button on my index.html that uses a JS promise to display the fetched data. The section with a title header that reads, 'Want to learn more about Luke Skywalker?' is where the button can be found.
