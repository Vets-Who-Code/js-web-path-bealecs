**Updates**
> I changed the navbar and footer section to be frames so that I could make them into components. I also added the prototyping as asked in issue 5. Minor changes to UI 
like changing text boxes, and updating form page were also made.  

**My 5 Laws that were utilized**

**Jakob's law**
 > Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
 > I would say this is a solid comparison https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp the form for the site will be fairly basic as it is solely a contact form meant to capture name, email, and message. The only differences that are typically found with contact forms is CSS differences or different input methods like phone number or ect.. A familiar contact form is easy to navigate and users know what is expected of them. This is why I associated Jakob's law with the contact form

**Law of Common Region**
 > Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.
 > Check out the Projects page; this law is displayed with grouped together projects that all belong together. You could even argue by using nav list items,
you are using law of common region by placing like items in similar nav links

 **Law of Proximity**
 > Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together
 > This law seemed to be very similar to the common region law to me, however this can be exemplified all throughout my portfolio, with nav links all grouped together, projects together, about information all together, and ect....

 **Postel's Law**
 > Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.
 > I am not sending any info to the user, however users can leave feedback via the feedback input section or reach out to contact with a personalized message

 **Miller's Law**
 > The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory
 > When reworking the projects cards, I broke them down and made it a little more simple to digest by changing it to carousel theme. This law is also exhibited by giving the resume and contact form their own pages for viewing.
