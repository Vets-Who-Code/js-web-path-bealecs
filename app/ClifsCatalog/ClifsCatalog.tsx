            This catalog was my most long-standing project I would say. It
            started with me when I began my journey with web development. From
            learning about API requests to adding user authentication, this site
            has some pretty cool features.
            <br />
            <br />
            Firstly, I utilized Create-React-App to get started with a fresh
            react app. From there, I started creating some of the components for
            the UI layout, and then began fetching my data..
            <br />
            <br />
            For my meal data, I leveraged TheMealDB to fetch meal data from all
            different kinds of categories. I started out only generating random
            meals with the meal generator, but as my learnings expanded, I
            figured out how to browse through specific categories and meal ID
            #s. My user authentication is handled through Auth0. <br />
            <br />
            Like many of my other projects, I was juggling multiple unfamiliar
            technologies, and learning as I went along the way. One area of
            struggle for me was setting up the search by meal ID # function.
            Overall it was definitely an enriching experience.
