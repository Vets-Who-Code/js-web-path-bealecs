                    <p>Paul is a long standing friend of mine from around the age of 11. When my programming journey started, Paul was there with me as well.
                        We learned a bit of Java together and have been in touch up to today. <br />
                        <br />
                        Paul since moved on and started teaching himself the ins-and-outs of the forex trading market. After years of experiences, gains and losses, he has learned a lot.
                        His goal is to help teach what he went through to avoid the 'bull****'. <br />
                        <br />
                        I decided to help him with his mentorship course by creating him a subscription based website. This site utilizes NextJS Framework, Firebase and firestore for database and usermanagement,
                        and Stripe for the subscription integration. <br />
                        <br />
                        This proved to be one of my toughest challenges yet, as I was juggling multiple unfamiliar technologies, and learning as I went along the way. I definitely struggled when it came to
                        setting up user authentication with firebase, but their documentation definitely helped out a lot! Overall it was definitely an enriching experience.
