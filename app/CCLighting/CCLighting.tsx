            A starting exterior lighting company started by my older brother and
            also a lifelong friend of mine. I thought it would be a great
            opportunity for all of us if I created a website for them. <br />
            <br />I was able to leverage just about all of the information I
            needed off of their company
            <a
              className={CCLightingStyles.anchor}
              href="https://www.facebook.com/crossandcarlilelighting/"
              rel="noopener noreferrer"

            >

            </a>
            and create something that can hopefully bring in more customers for
            their business. <br />
            <br />
            React was the only tool that I utilized for this project. I created
            it fairly quickly, and mostly as a surprise. As the functionality
            *for now* is low, I figured it would be best handled this way.{" "}
            <br />
            <br />
            This project was definitely less challenging than others, but I
            listed it here as I found that it was a practical, real world
            showcase. I am proud of what I have been able to accomplish here,
            and with all of my projects.
