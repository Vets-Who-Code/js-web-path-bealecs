  "description": "1. **VQS Program.** The VetsWhoCode Qualification Standard (VQS) program is a qualification\r system of basic Training Performance Objectives (TPO) designed to establish the minimum level of\r competency required for a member to successfully perform in their grade. This VQS is a compilation of\r the minimum knowledge and skills that an individual must demonstrate in order to qualify for\r advancement. The objective of VQS is to standardize and facilitate these qualifications.\r 1. **CONTENTS.** The VQS is divided into 12 sections. Each section is divided into subsections (issues list). The issues list can be found under the `Issues` tab of this Github Repository. Each issue is broken up into 3 sections:\r     1. TPO: Each TPO is formatted using the Army's formula for training tasks to standard as in the following:\r         1. **Task:** A clearly defined and measurable activity accomplished by individuals. Tasks are specific activities that contribute to the accomplishment of encompassing requirements. Different types of Tasks are:\r             1. **DEMONSTRATE.** Given a scenario members must physically demonstrate from memory and with references in the presence of a VQS qualifier the subject performance factor.\r             1. **USE.** Members must demonstrate through a Github Pull Request, with the aid of appropriate references, the ability to complete standards using a specified tool.\r         1. **Conditions:** The environment and boilerplate needed to perform the task.\r         1. **Standard:** A list of the minimum acceptable proficiencies required in the performance of the training task under a specific set of conditions.\r     1. Notes: This section gives hints/resources that could help to complete the task or go deeper. However, it is not required to incorporate notes into your project.\r     1. Resources: A list of resources that contain all prerequisite knowledge to accomplish the TPO.\r 1. **VQS QUALIFIERS.** The VQS Qualifier is designated in writing by the Executive Director to sign off\r individual VQS line items. Qualifiers will normally be field professionals, as a minimum, must have\r completed the VQS they are authorized to sign off. The names of designated Qualifiers can be found on\r the VQS Progress Chart or Command Qualifiers List.\r 1. **TRAINEE.**  You must demonstrate your knowledge to a designated VQS qualifier. You have one year\r from the date of your first signature to complete this VQS. Failure to complete VQS within the one year\r time limit will result in invalidation of those signatures that go beyond the time limit or in the invalidation of\r the entire VQS. The requirements of this VQS may be satisfied through formal training or self-instruction.\r 1. **FINAL INTERVIEW.** To successfully complete this course you must have a final interview with a VQS qualifier. The final interview will be conducted in the form of a mock job interview and will focus solely on the content covered in the course. Candidates should expect to demonstrate their understanding of concepts and skills through practical application and problem-solving scenarios.",
