# Issue 11

#### I am still in the process of issue 11

#### Since it is such a big PR coming up, and a lot of new changes, I am going to walk through it here. Most of it is moving the css over to be modularized, and making components out of the html. I have added many style changes to accompany a move to better suit NextJS. The new routes from NextJS provided easy navigation, and so I modified the look of my page. 

#### There is a components folder which houses some of the basic components, and then folders solely designated for their page route based off of their content.

#### The deploy preview will have an example of the issue 11, if you just click the footer link that says leave some feedback

#### Note for VWC Mentors: There were some gray areas with the newer technologies of NextJS not utilizing getServerSideProps anymore. I utilized their app router structure as it is the suggested structure now.

P.S. Apologies for the terribly long PR
