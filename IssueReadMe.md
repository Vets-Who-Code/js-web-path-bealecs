# Issue 10

#### I have finished with issue 10 and it is ready for review:

#### For this issue, I had to npm install React and React DOM. After doing that, I went ahead and started setting up a seperate folder for the react files, and added a second child folder to the react folder for components (such as the theme switcher). 

#### The React folder contains 3 files, an index.jsx which renders the 'App' component. The App.jsx file contains all of the jsx and logic for the issue 10 section, and finally there is the CSS page which is just styles specifically for the issue 10 section as a module. This directory also contains, as aforementioned, the components directory. Inside here, I have created my component for the theme switcher. The theme switcher changes the background color for the body element of the page

#### Note for VWC Mentors: If this was not the folder structure that was in mind for the project, please let me know and I will promptly make changes accordingly. Thanks for reading!
