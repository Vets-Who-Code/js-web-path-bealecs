# Issue 9

#### I am currently embarking on issue number 9, and have decided to clean up the Read Me's once again to make it more accessible. I am deleting the read me folder, and creating this file at the root of the project. 

#### I have also deleted the /Portfolio directory and went with the /src directory for the sake of parcel. All directories and files were moved from the /Portfolio directory into the /src directory as a result.

#### I have made an initial commit so far, marking my progress of setting up parcel and Typescript into my project. While still reading through Typescript documentation, I am working on the steps outlined in issue 9.
