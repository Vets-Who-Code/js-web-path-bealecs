# Issue 9

#### I am currently embarking on issue number 9, and have decided to clean up the Read Me's once again to make it more accessible. I am deleting the read me folder, and creating this file at the root of the project. 

#### For this issue, I had to move some files around to reflect the switch to Parcel; this included changing over to a /src directory folder, as per the docs of parcel. I have condensed my readme to just this file, and will update this file accordingly from now on, issue to issue, unless there is a discrepancy with that. 

#### I am ready for review on my issue 9 now. I needed to go back through the documentation of typescript before getting started, but I am now pretty confident that I have followed the instructions correctly. Check out the console log, and it is the latter array listed there. (please note that the first console log is from previous issue: #6). 

#### Note for VWC Mentors: If this was not the folder structure that was in mind for the project, please let me know and I will promptly make changes accordingly. Thanks for reading!
